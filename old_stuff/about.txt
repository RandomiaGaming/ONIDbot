What is ONIDbot?
ONIDbot is a free open source Discord bot which can be added to a server in just a few clicks.
It was developed by Finlay Christ a cybersecurity major here at Oregon State University.
ONIDbot is designed to collect and verify the OSU email addresses of your server's members.
You have full control over which permissions are granted to @everyone and which require the ONIDVerified role.
That means you can customize how strict the rules should be based upon your community prioreties.

Why do I even need ONIDbot?
As soon as your Discord server link gets posted on social media that server becomes a public space.
People from around the world can join regardless of student status or intentions.
Even the links you post on IdealLogic are public!
And while banning a single account is easy, without verification trolls can create new accounts with just a few clicks and get right back to their mischief.
With ONIDbot you add accountability by requiring a valid OSU email address.
And with that email address our bot can lookup the student's name which makes it easy to hold them accountable.

Getting Started:
Step one is to add ONIDbot to your server by clicking the link below and following Discord's instructions
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1344219132027076629
Next you will need to verify yourself with ONIDbot by typing /verify. Note this is the only command you are allowed to run without verification.
Next you will need to specify which role to give after verification by typing /set_verified_role
Then you will need to decide if ONIDbot should nickname users by running /do_nicknames
Then you will need to post the verification instructions with /post_instructions
Or if you just want the verify button and no instructions you can type /post_verify_button
Now you are all set up!

Debugging:
Check which role is given to verified members with /get_verified_role
Reset the verified role to contain all the verified members and nobody else with /refresh_verified_role
Reset the nickname of verified members with /refresh_nicknames (Doesn't change users who used to be verified back to their original name)


/verify (onid: str) - Sends a verification link to the given ONID if it's valid according to the API.
/config (set_nicknames: bool) (verified_role: role) - Configures weather nicknames are changed to "First Last" after verification or not and which role to assign to verified members.
/instructions - Posts the instructions including the verify button to the current channel.
/verify_button - Posts the verify button only into the current channel.
/user_info (user: member) - Returns the following info about a user: Discord ID, Discord Username, Account Age, Membership Age, ONID email or empty, Has verified role, Name first and last.

All commands require the issuer to be an administrator of the current server.
All commands other than /verify require the user to be verified within ONIDbot's database.
